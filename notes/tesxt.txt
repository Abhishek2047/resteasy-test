we can send data in three ways as part of the http request
1:
  uri
2:
  header
3:
  body 
  
 using uri :
 			we can send the data using uri in three ways
 			1: querry parameter 
 			2: path parameter(template parameter)
 			3: matrix parameter 
 			
 			querry param:
 					*	when the data is optional then we go for querry param because it does not take part in identifying 
 						the resource by matching uri with resource path 
 					*   mulivalues are possible
 					*   can appear only at the end of uri
 					*  	difficult to remember the syntax
 					*   difficult for end user to understand
 					*   not easily bookmarkable 
 					*   scoped to the whole uri (global) 
 					
 					
 			path param :
 					* when data is mandatory then we sholud go for path parameter because it takes part in matching the 
 					  uri with resource path
 					* multi value are not possible
 					* can appear at any place as part of the uri
 					* easy to remember syntax
 					* easy for end user to access 
 					* data send as part of the path parameter is scoped to the whole uri(global)
 			
 			matrix param :
 					* when we want to add additonal information/data to a particular path paramter/path segment then we go for matrix parameter
 					* these are optional
 					* multi values are possible
 					* appears with the path parameters only
 					* scoped to the path parameter
